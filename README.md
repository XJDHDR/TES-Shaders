# TES-Shaders
Oblivion and Skyrim vanilla shaders.
Files contain the unpacked fxp files and a tool (by Ethatron and revisited by me) to rebuild a pseudo HLSL code.</br>

You need a linux bash (Cygwin or WinBash) Perl and Python to use the tool:</br>
- Copy the shader(s) you want to decompile from the Disasm folder into the Disassembly folder
- Run the convert.sh
- Adjust something if needed
- Run the reorder.sh

In this way, you can see how the original shader works and you can modify it and replace/inject it by Oblivion/Skyrim Reloaded.
